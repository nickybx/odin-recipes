    <p>If you are not eating this thing atleast one time per week, you are wasting your life.. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken or Pork</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Seasonings (salt, pepper, vegeta, etc.)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>(Follow in order)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour on a plate. Coat chicken in flour. <br> Shake off excess â€“ this helps prevent a gluggy coating on the finished schnitzel.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow bowl. <br> Dip flour-coated chicken in egg mixture. Let excess egg mixture drip back into bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine breadcrumbs, cheese, lemon rind, parsley and garlic powder on a plate. <br> Season with salt and pepper. Dip egg-coated chicken in breadcrumb mixture. Gently press on with fingertips to secure.        </li>
        <li>Cook schnitzels, in batches, for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. <br> Cooking in batches helps maintain oil temperature and prevents schnitzels becoming soggy.</li>

    </ol>
